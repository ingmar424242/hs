1
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:13,190
Whose turn is it?

2
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,798
I'd like one of those little...

3
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:19,512
Do you have toys? I need a Christmas present for my grandchild.

4
00:00:19,512 --> 00:00:21,120
Do you have anything particular in mind?

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,111
It's got to be something that goes "boom"!

6
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:24,833
How old is the child?

7
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,225
About this tall.

8
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:28,150
Is it a boy or a girl?

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,773
Well...

10
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:32,317
Well, you must know if your grandchild is a boy or a girl.

11
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:33,411
Why is that?

12
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:35,277
Anyway, what's the little one's name?

13
00:00:35,277 --> 00:00:37,334
Hoppenstedt. We're all called Hoppenstedt.

14
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:38,603
And what's the firstname?

15
00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:40,418
Dickie. Dickie Hoppenstedt.

16
00:00:40,418 --> 00:00:41,931
And it's a girl?

17
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:42,741
No.

18
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:44,010
So it's a boy.

19
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,064
No, no, no, no, no!

20
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:46,118
So what is it then?

21
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:48,153
I can't tell you exactly.

22
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:49,484
Well, what does your grandchild wear?

23
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:50,969
Trousers. Blue trousers.

24
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,613
Well, maybe you've seen them without trousers?

25
00:00:53,613 --> 00:00:56,131
No. Why would I?

26
00:00:57,972 --> 00:01:00,474
Say, what kind of a shop is this anyway?

27
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:06,672
Please! I only asked the gentleman if his grandchild is a boy or a girl.

28
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:09,122
If your grandchild has got a willie, one should be able to...

29
00:01:09,122 --> 00:01:10,668
Willie?

30
00:01:10,668 --> 00:01:12,771
For God's sake! Your grandchild doesn't have a willie then.

31
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:14,513
My grandchild has everything needed!

32
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:18,789
Healthy parents, a decent home and strict discipline.

33
00:01:20,784 --> 00:01:24,732
So do you sell toys for decent children or not?

34
00:01:24,732 --> 00:01:29,842
This is a new toy for boys and girls from five to ten.

35
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:33,202
It's very popular. "Let's build a nuclear power plant"

36
00:01:33,202 --> 00:01:36,340
It's fun for the kids and the parents.

37
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,592
It's really something for the entire family.

38
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:44,140
These are the instructions and those are the parts that need to be assembled.

39
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:50,337
The burning chamber, uranium core, cooling system, neutron accelerator and the containment structure.

40
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:51,729
And what is this?

41
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,971
These are trees, houses and cows for the scenery.

42
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:56,295
Everything has been beautifully made.

43
00:01:56,295 --> 00:01:58,866
Does it go "boom"?

44
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:02,890
Yes, if you make a mistake, there will be a small explosion.

45
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,825
Of course nothing big. After all, it's for kids.

46
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:09,315
But it goes "boom" and the cows, little houses, and trees fall over .

47
00:02:09,315 --> 00:02:11,953
It's always a big surprise and a lot of fun.

48
00:02:11,953 --> 00:02:12,976
Would you like to take it?

49
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:14,061
Yes!

50
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:15,145
That's ll be 64.50 marks.

51
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:17,294
You'll get one in the original packaging.

52
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:18,656
Do you take play money?

53
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:20,325
No!

54
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:21,594
Keep the change!

55
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:25,068
I wish you a merry Christmas and a lot of fun with the nice game!

56
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:35,124
There used to be more lametta!

57
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:37,271
This year the tree stays green. Naturally green!

58
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:38,909
With fresh and natural apples.

59
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,513
Naturally green and eco-friendly.

60
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:41,751
And when will I get my present?

61
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:44,275
First, we'll decorate the tree.

62
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:46,308
Then Dickie will recite a poem, then we'll get the presents in,

63
00:02:46,308 --> 00:02:49,163
then we'll watch the Christmas programme on the first channel,

64
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:51,193
then we'll unwrap the presents and finally we'll sit down and relax.

65
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:56,857
No, Walter! First, we'll get the presents in, then Dickie will recite a poem

66
00:02:56,857 --> 00:02:59,678
and we'll unwrap the presents, then we'll tidy up while watching TV

67
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:01,258
and finally we'll sit down and relax.

68
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:03,575
And when will I get my present?

69
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:06,698
Or we could first watch the Christmas programme on the third channel

70
00:03:06,698 --> 00:03:10,988
while unwrapping the presents and afterwards we could sit down and relax.

71
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:15,098
Dickie, will you please stay in your room?! Santa Claus will be very angry if you don't listen!

72
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:16,521
There used to be more lametta!

73
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:18,838
This year the tree is green and eco-friendly.

74
00:03:18,838 --> 00:03:23,123
Merry Christmas! Let's go! Grampa will help me a little

75
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:24,392
and Dad will turn on the Christmas lights.

76
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:27,980
Yes!

77
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:29,785
Merry Christmas!

78
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:31,300
What?

79
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,600
Merry Christmas!

80
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,255
Merry Christmas!

81
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,166
Dickie, where are you?

82
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,044
Merry Christmas, my darling!

83
00:03:40,044 --> 00:03:47,309
Merry Christmas! Oops!

84
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:54,673
Dickie would like to recite a poem for us.

85
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:58,215
Clip, clap! Chicken crap!

86
00:03:58,215 --> 00:03:59,617
No, not that one!

87
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:03,462
Let's unwrap the presents!

88
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:25,954
Who could that be?

89
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:29,049
Come in!

90
00:04:30,543 --> 00:04:32,658
Well, Dickie!

91
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:33,711
Dickie!

92
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:35,165
Look who it is!

93
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:38,035
Grampa!

94
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:41,603
I want to have my present now!

95
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:43,265
Here's your present, Grampa!

96
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:45,265
And why don't you relax a little?!

97
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:50,507
Look, Walter! It's a Heinzelmann vacuum blower, in the original packaging!

98
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:53,071
A tie!

99
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:09,689
Look, it's a record player!

100
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:13,124
Now you can always play your favourite records in your room.

101
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:15,391
Look at the tree!

102
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,980
A tie!

103
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,384
Grampa, don't!

104
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:20,653
I want to play my record!

105
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,747
Go and look for another socket!

106
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:26,804
Don't be so nasty!

107
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:35,590
A tie!

108
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,652
This is really cosy!

109
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,976
Grampa, don't! Come sit down and watch TV with us!

110
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:54,587
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

111
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:19,922
Grampa, why don't you have a look at the tree instead?!

112
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,218
I am!

113
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:24,349
Is Dad going to play the nice new game with Dickie?

114
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,941
Look, Dickie! "Let's build a nuclear power plant"

115
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:33,448
There are trees, houses, and cows. They'd like to have a nice nuclear power plant.

116
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:34,860
And this is where we'll build it.

117
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,927
Alas, if only it was Christmas everyday.

118
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:43,022
This is the little neutron accelerator, this is the burning chamber...Dickie!

119
00:06:43,022 --> 00:06:45,817
Don't knock over the cow!

120
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:52,141
And now we're going to carefully insert the tiny uranium core into the burning chamber

121
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:55,508
and the containment structure goes on top.

122
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:58,018
Done!

123
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,184
Can Mum watch, too?

124
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:02,878
If we made a mistake, it should go "boom" now.

125
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:04,116
Why "boom"?

126
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:05,705
For God's sake! It just goes "boom"!

127
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,678
Then all the houses and cows fall over.

128
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,521
Fantastic!

129
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:13,619
But it doesn't go "boom"!

130
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:19,574
It went "boom"!

131
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:21,969
Lovely!

132
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:27,156
The Hoppenstedt family would like to wish you a merry Christmas!

133
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:28,486
Is this really necessary?

134
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:31,948
Yes, it is. After all, it's a game for kids

135
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:34,704
and Christmas is a holiday for the kids.

136
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,095
Let's cover it up.

137
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:37,602
Dad, we're proud of you!

138
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:39,506
I don't want to deal with these squares on Christmas Eve.

139
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:42,712
Alright, let's sit down and relax!

140
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,426
Let's tidy up first!

141
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:49,326
And you're going to bed now, Dickie! It's best to leave the party when it's still fun.

142
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:10,060
Let's just put it all in the staircase! Let's see if the coast is clear!

143
00:08:17,742 --> 03:59:59,999
Hello? Do you need a Santa Claus?
